# Understanding Python Objects, Identity, Mutability, and Function Arguments

## Introduction

One of the most interesting ideas for new Python developers is the phrase:
“Everything is an object.”
This simple sentence explains much of Python’s behavior — from why integers sometimes share the same memory, to why lists can unexpectedly change, to why passing objects into functions behaves differently depending on whether the object is mutable or immutable.

In this post, I’ll walk through what Python objects really are, what id and type mean, how assignment works, how references are created, how mutability affects behavior, how Python stores immutable objects in memory, and even the behind-the-scenes details about small integer pre-allocation like NSMALLPOSINTS and NSMALLNEGINTS.
By the end, you’ll understand the Python object model at a deep level — and you’ll never look at a simple variable assignment the same way again.


## ID and Type: What Python Knows About Every Object

Every Python object has two essential attributes:
- type: the kind of object (e.g., int, list, tuple)
  
- id: its unique identity (based on memory address in CPython)

```
a = 42
print(type(a)) # <class 'int'>
print(id(a)) # e.g. 140723947502992
```

Two variables can refer to equal values yet still be different objects:
```
x = [1, 2]
y = [1, 2]

print(x == y) # True (same content)
print(x is y) # False (different identity / id)
```

The id() function is the exact tool CPython uses to display the memory address (the variable identifier).


## Assignment, Referencing, and Aliasing

A key idea many beginners miss is this:
assignment does not copy objects — it creates references.
```
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a # b is an alias of a
```
Here, a and b refer to the same object.

This is aliasing.

Memory diagram:
```
a ───┐
│
b ───┘ → [1, 2, 3]
```
Mutation through one reference affects the other:
```
a.append(4)
print(b) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```


## Mutable Objects

A mutable object is one whose content can change in place.
Python’s built-in mutable types are:
- list
- dict
- set
- bytearray

These do not create new objects when modified:
```
l = [1, 2]
print(id(l))
l.append(3)
print(id(l)) # same id → mutated in place
```


## Immutable Objects

An immutable object cannot be changed after creation.
Python’s built-in immutable types include:
- numbers (int, float, complex)
- string
- tuple
- frozenset
- bytes

With immutable objects, any “change” results in a new object:
```
a = 5
print(id(a))
a += 1 # creates new int
print(id(a)) # different id
```
Even though tuple is immutable:
```
t = (1, 2, 3)
```
A tuple can contain mutable elements:
```
t = (1, [2, 3])
t[1].append(4)
print(t) # (1, [2, 3, 4])
```
This is the “immutable but potentially changing” behavior.
Frozen sets behave the same way: the container is immutable, but if it contains mutable objects (which is rare in practice), the internal mutation can still occur.



## How Immutable Objects Are Stored in Memory

Because immutable objects cannot change, Python can safely reuse them.
This is why:
```
a = 10
b = 10
print(a is b) # True
```
Both variables refer to the exact same integer object.

For strings:
```
s1 = "hello"
s2 = "hello"
print(s1 is s2) # True (string interning)
```
Python may intern small immutable objects for efficiency.

Memory diagram example (immutable reuse):
```
a ───→ 10 ←── b
```


## Integer Pre-Allocation: NSMALLPOSINTS and NSMALLNEGINTS

When CPython starts, it preallocates 262 small integers:
- integers from –5 to 256
- total = NSMALLPOSINTS + NSMALLNEGINTS = 257 + 5

This range is defined internally by two constants:
- NSMALLPOSINTS = 257
- NSMALLNEGINTS = 5

## Why these values?

Because integers in this range are used constantly—indexing, loops, boolean operations, function return values, and many internal C structures.
Reusing them saves memory and speeds up execution.

Example:
```
a = 100
b = 100
print(a is b) # True (interned small integer)

x = 300
y = 300
print(x is y) # False (not preallocated)
```
This is one of the most surprising features for new Python learners.



## Why Mutability Matters: How Python Treats Them Differently

Mutability influences:

✔ Memory usage

Immutable objects can be safely reused
Mutable objects must be copied or referenced carefully

✔ Performance

Immutable values avoid unnecessary allocations
Mutable types minimize expensive duplication when changed in place

✔ Function behavior

This is where the biggest confusion occurs.



### How Python Passes Variables to Functions (By Assignment)

Python uses a system called pass-by-assignment or call-by-object-reference.

This means:
- The function receives the reference to the object
- But reassigning the parameter inside the function does not affect the caller
- Mutating the object does affect the caller

Example with immutable:
```
def inc(n):
n += 1 # new int, does not affect caller

a = 1
inc(a)
print(a) # 1
```
Example with mutable:
```
def append_item(lst):
lst.append(99) # modifies in place

l = [1, 2]
append_item(l)
print(l) # [1, 2, 99]
```
Rebinding inside functions:
```
def replace_list(lst):
lst = [9, 9, 9] # rebinds local variable only

l = [1, 2, 3]
replace_list(l)
print(l) # still [1, 2, 3]
```
Memory diagram #2:

Before call:
```
lst ───→ [1, 2, 3]
```
Inside function after rebinding:
```
lst ───→ [9, 9, 9] (local)
```
(original list untouched)

This distinction is critical for writing bug-free code.



## Conclusion

Understanding Python’s object model — identity, references, assignment, mutability, aliasing, and how objects behave when passed to functions — unlocks a much deeper understanding of the language. Concepts like integer preallocation, small integer caching, and how immutable objects are stored in memory reveal the hidden optimizations CPython performs for us.
Once you understand these ideas, everyday Python behavior becomes predictable and intuitive, and you can write far more robust, memory-efficient, and maintainable programs.
